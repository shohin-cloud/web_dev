    <h1>Thanks</h1>
    <p>
       Thanks for the tree<br>
between me & a sniper’s bullet.<br>
I don’t know what made the grass<br>
sway seconds before the Viet Cong<br>
raised his soundless rifle.<br>
Some voice always followed,<br>
telling me which foot<br>
to put down first.<br>
Thanks for deflecting the ricochet<br>
against that anarchy of dusk
